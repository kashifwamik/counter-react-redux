# Counter React Redux App

This is a simple **Counter App** built with **React** and **Redux** as as well **ReduxJS Toolkit**for store management. The app demonstrates state management using Redux, allowing you to increment, decrement, add, and subtract values. It also features conditional rendering and a toggle functionality that hides the counter display. The styling is a combination of **Bootstrap** and custom CSS for a polished and responsive UI.

## Features

- **Increment/Decrement Counter**: Increase or decrease the counter by 1.
- **Add/Subtract Custom Values**: Add or subtract custom values to/from the counter.
- **Reset Counter**: Reset the counter to zero.
- **Toggle Display**: Switch between showing or hiding the counter display using a toggle button.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: The app is divided into reusable functional components for better maintainability.
- **Redux Store Management**: The app manages the state of the counter using Redux actions, reducers, and a store.
- **Bootstrap Integration**: The UI is enhanced with Bootstrap for responsive and sleek design.

##Modified

- **Redux Store Management**: The app manages the state of the counter using Redux Toolkit's configureStore, createSlice, and built-in actions and reducers for efficient state management.
